## Zip()
### Challenge Description
- Pass in two linkedlists, and create a new linkedlist (or mutate one of the two) so that it takes one, then the other, and moves from head to tail until all are "zipped" up. Use as few other methods as possible.

### Approach & Efficiency
- Time O(n) (have to iterate through everything)
- SpaceO(2n) - create something that is the size of both of them, but mutates the first LinkedList passed in.
