## Array Binary Search

Objective: take in 2 args (a sorted array and its search key), and return the index of the array's element equal to the search key or -1 if the element doesn't exist.

#### Challenge

No use of built-in methods, and the search algorithm should be a binary search.

#### Approach & Efficiency

Time: O(1)
Space: O(n)
